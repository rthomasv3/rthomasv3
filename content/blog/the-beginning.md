It all started when a second internet service provider finally came to my area - which was quickly followed by a third and then a fourth...

With _so_ many options now I could actually shop around a bit. And who would have guessed? Suddenly, I could get my current internet for cheaper or opt for new, shiny, also-discounted internet.<!--more-->

Drunk on my new found power, I ordered the fastest option available and took all coupons and _special_ discounts I could get. Gone are the days of 10 megabits up - this is the age of the gigabit! On top of that, they sent me a $100 prepaid card.

So what will I do with all of that speed? Well, first, it turns out you can turn a $100 prepaid card into a HP DL380 G7 server with two Xeon X5660s. It even came with both 750w PSUs, 32GB of RAM, a PCI riser, and fully populated hard drive bays!

And with that, the journey begins.
